# 2D Rigid Body Simulation

![Rigid Body Screenshot](https://github.com/perezite/rigid-body/blob/main/docs/screenshots/RigidBodyScreenshot2.png?raw=true)

A simple 2D rigid body physics simulation.

## Description 

This program is a 2D physics simulation, inspired by the [Rigid Body Dynamics Tutorial by Chris Hecker](https://www.chrishecker.com/Rigid_Body_Dynamics)

The program simulates a freely movable two dimensional cube which hangs on two ropes. The end of one rope can be moved around using the mouse.  
The two ropes can be toggled on or off. If you set them to off, the cube will fall to the ground in a physically accurate way.  

## Controls

- Arrow keys / Mouse: Move position of the left rope
- Y: Toggle left rope
- X: Toggle right rope
- G: Toggle gravity
